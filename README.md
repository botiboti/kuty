# Kutyaszorító game

This game uses the Minimax algorithm to try and beat the player. Clone in and launch the game like this:
```python
python console.py 1 3 3
```
With the first argument you can choose who starts the game(1 for the bot and 0 for the user), the second argument is the board size(in the example above this means it's a 3x3 board) and the last one is the depth of the search tree.

Have fun!
